Code Refactoring 

In this project I refactored existing code to be more accessible for the end user 

I was able to replace existibg tags with more semantic tags (section, footer, header, nav etc)

I added alternative attributes to images and elements within the website to make it more accessible for end users 

I used CSS and class selectors to clean up the nav bar and header for easier access for the end user
