 # Code Refactoring

## Description

In this project I refactored existing code to make it more accessible to the end user 
The starter code lacked accessiblity in specific areas such as semantic tags and alt attributes



- I replaced existing tags with semantic tags to make them more accessible 

- I applied alt attribute tags to images to make them more accessible to end users using screen readers

- I edited the nav bar to clean it up and make it more end user friendly 

By applying these changes I believe that I have made the website more accessible and easier to navigate for the end user
